# Movie_recommender

Hey everyone,

This is a **Movie Recommender Model** that uses Content-Based Filtering to suggest movies to users. Iâ€™ve specifically implemented the Bag of Words approach to group high-frequency words, which helps in finding similarities between a given movie and all the other movies in the dataset.

# Dataset:
You can find the dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata

 # Frontend & Similarity Files:
For the frontend, youâ€™ll need some .pkl files. Iâ€™ve added one of them here.
Also, for movie similarity, youâ€™ll need another .pkl file. You can generate it by referring to the app.py and movieRecommender.ipynb files.

# Note:
Sorry for the inconvenience! ðŸ˜… Iâ€™ve already hit the 100 MB limit on Git LFS, so couldnâ€™t upload more files.

Thanks for checking it out! ðŸš€
